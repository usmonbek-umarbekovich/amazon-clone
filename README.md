# Amazon Clone

`When you go to the website, chrome may complain about the security.`\
`I haven't figured out how to get rid of that warning.`

**For checking out payment functionality, keep typing `42` on the card input field:**\
`4242 4242 4242 4242 ...`

The application has everything that regular e-commerce application has.
It includes authentication, products, checkout, payment system and very similar design to actual amazon website.
